### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Issa. I'm a graduate of computer engineering at the PNU University, also managed to get a master of science in information technology at the University of Qom. I took up developing software/web-app as a career after majoring in computer software engineering. I helped to develop some software, packages, websites, and web applications with some awesome technologies such as sass, bootstrap, Javascript, Typescript, Nodejs, React, Material-ui, SQL, MongoDB, DevOps, and Scrum!  
The capability of applications to make vast changes in society and human culture has impressed me so much. To me, the software is a way to lever up human culture and fix all misunderstandings that humans caused. My goal is to make computers think, understand, and make decisions that are more providing human rights and peace!
