### Hi there 👋

<!--
**easa/easa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning google cloud functions
<!-- - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on applications with computational difficulties -->
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting a full-time job out of Iran >______<
- 💬 Ask me about software development, protocols and methods, javascript, typescript, machine learning, data science, AI, and stuff like these. I have a MSc in IT ;)
- 📫 How to reach me: find me by @eisanodehi everywhere
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm learning quantum physics and quantum computing. So I like to talk about this stuff
